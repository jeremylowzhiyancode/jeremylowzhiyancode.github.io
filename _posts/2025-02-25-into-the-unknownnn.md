today is the day i create my github page. What is it for? where will this journey lead me? who knows? sometimes i think to myself if any of this is worth it? maybe it is, maybe it isn't. but who cares where it leads? maybe i should just enjoy the process, learn and take things as they come. Go with the flow, as they call it. here goes nothing!
